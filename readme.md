# Introduction
---------------
Plants vs Zombies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies) is a tower-defense and strategy game which involves an army of zombies trying to enter the house(lawn) and eat your brains. The only way you can stop them is by using your arsenal of plants that will zap the zombies at your command. The plants - Pea-shooters, Beetroots, Walnuts, and Sunflowers - are all set to destroy the zombies who dare to enter your backyard.

# Guide
--------
The playing field is divided into 5 horizontal lanes, a zombie will only move towards the player's house along one lane . Planting costs "sun" (sun acts as the currency for the game, required for buying plants), which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) and also by planting the sunflower plant which generates a sun at regular intervals. Plants can only attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in.

In our implementation we have provided the users with 4 plants:

* PeaShooter - Peashooter is the first and the primary attacking plant the game. It is a peashooting plant that shoots peas on seeing a zombie. It costs 100 suns.
* BeetRoot - The users have another attacking plant , the BeetRoot which shoots beets insteasd of peas which are faster and hence is priced a bit higher at 125 suns.
* SunFlower - Sunflower is an essential sun-producing plant which is necessary for producing suns - the currency of the game. It costs 50 suns. Each sun produced from sunflower adds 25 units to your sun counter.
* Walnut - Walnut is the defensive plant that acts as a shield for the player's plants. It takes a long time for zombies to eat it, providing an effective cover for the plants located behind it. It is mainly used to stall zombies to waste their time, letting other plants attack them.

In this mini-version we implemented only 2 zombies:

* Normal Zombie - Normal zombies and their time-themed variants in Plants vs. Zombies 2 are the most basic "zombie" units. In fact, it takes four shots for a pea plant to kill them. Having no special defensive equipment or travel abilities, these zombies are susceptible to any type of attack.
* Football Zombie - It's a tough zombie and it takes the PeaShooter 5 shots to kill it.
